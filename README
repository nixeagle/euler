This repository is a collection of work by various members of the
eighthbit.net irc network. The code in this repository is stored in
directories by problem number.

Eg code that solves problem number 1 go in the directory 1/ and so on.

If a problem requires data files or other things, they can go in the
directory as well.

The copyright of the code is released under the MIT license unless
otherwise stated at the top of each code file.

Finally some notes: This is a group effort by the members of
irc://irc.eighthbit.net/#euler.


As far as submissions to project-euler it is under the honor code that you
submit only work that you yourself have done and have learned how to do.

The rules for #euler are as follows

 1. Any and all programming languages are permitted, the channel #euler is
 not an appropriate place to debate which language is better. (However it
 is an appropriate place to debate which _algorithm_ is better).

 2. Any member of the channel may view any of the files and suggest to
 those authors ways to improve their code. However putting down any member
 of the channel or their code, or their choice of language is not
 acceptable.

 3. Members of the channel by participating agree to be open to positive
 constructive criticism of their work. This goes hand in hand with not
 negatively criticizing others work.

 4. In general a negative attitude in #euler is a good way to be quieted
 for a few hours. A non exhaustive list of examples are as follows:
   - Complaining that <foo> is difficult
   - Complaining that <foo> is stupid
   - Complaining about other unrelated issues, we have #offtopic for that
   - Complaining about other channel members, you may take those
     complaints to #eighthbit.
